<h4>September 2021 – October 2022</h4>
<p>During my time here I was responsible for many complex medical cases, excelled at emergency medicine, ultrasonography and soft tissue surgery and learnt more about orthopaedic surgeries. I became vastly more confident at dentistry. I developed an excellent rapport with clients and  staff alike and refined by skills as a clinician by working in this Accredited Hospital of Excellence.</p>

<p>Upon joining Central Vets I became a valued member of the team and excelled in client communication, emergency medicine, and surgery. I learnt valuable information about tropical diseases and gained experience in treating hookworms, parvovirus, leptospirosis, snake envenomation and tick paralysis. I continued to enjoy working up complex medical cases and learnt new surgical techniques such as splenectomies, and incisional gastropexies for GDVs.  </p>
<h3>West Coast Vets Ltd, Hokitika</h3>
<h4>August 2017-September 2018</h4>
<p>West Coast Vets is the only veterinary group in Westland, on the South Island of New Zealand. It covers farm animals, companion animals and equine, and also has a branch in the Grey District. Employed as a mixed practice veterinary surgeon (70% small animals, on average), I excelled in my small animal knowledge and skills, and developed excellent client and colleague relationships. I worked up complex medical cases both alone and with input from colleagues. I particularly enjoyed emergency medicine and surgery and performed several emergency caesarians, pyometra surgeries, and leg amputations.</p>
